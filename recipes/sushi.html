            <li>Preheat the oven to 300 degrees F (150 degrees C). On a medium baking sheet, heat nori in the preheated oven 1 to 2 minutes, until warm.</li>
            <li>Center one sheet nori on a bamboo sushi mat. Wet your hands. Using your hands, spread a thin layer ofrice on the sheet of nori, 
                and press into a thin layer. Arrange 1/4 of the cucumber, ginger, avocado, and imitation crabmeat in a line down the center of the rice. 
                Lift the end of the mat, and gently roll it over the ingredients, presssing gently. Roll it forward to make a complete roll. 
                Repeat with remaining ingredients.
