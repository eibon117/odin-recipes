        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>1 cup all-purpose flour</li>
            <li>2 eggs</li>
            <li>1/2 cup milk</li>
            <li>1/2 cup water</li>
            <li>1/4 teaspoon salt</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons butter, melted</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>In a large mixing bowl, whisk together the flour and the eggs. Gradually add in the milk and water,
                stirring to combine. Add the salt and butter; beat until smooth. 
            </li>
            <li>Heat a lighlty oiled griddle or frying pan over medium heat. Pour or scoop the batter onto the griddle, 
                using approximately 1/4 cup for each crepe. Tilt the pan with a circular motion so that the batter 
                coats the surface evenly.
            </li>
            <li>Cook the crepe for about 2 minutes, until the bottom is light brown. Loosen with a spatula, turn and 
                cook the other side. Serve hot.
